# Project1 - Memory Matching Game

<!-- //I used a tutorial for a lot of the ground work. I decided to watch half of the video, then let myself do the rest. I plan on working with an instructor on breaking down the code so I can understand why the man in the tutorial chose to do it this way. Here is the link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bznJPt4t_4s -->

This game just needs to show simple DOM manipulation. Don't over-think it!

1. Create a Repo and touch an HTML, CSS and JavaScript file
2. You are a solo player: make a scoreboard for yourself
3. Style your background and create a "face" to your game
4. Create a basic layout
5. Use defer to connect to the DOM

    1. Have my game be interactive
