        <p>While MemoryÂ® was first published in 1959 by Ravensburger for individuals and families to have fun, studies show that memory games like this can do a lot more for humans! Memory games are used by people affected by Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's, Demetia and adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to help improve working memory, fluid intelligence, recall, mood and overall cognitive funciton. It's the perfect mix of fun and brain exercise!</p>
